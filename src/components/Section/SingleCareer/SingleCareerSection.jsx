              <p>
                A designer plays a key role in a creative company. Using
                elements like typography, illustration, photography and layouts,
                a designer always has an extremely creative mind that can absorb
                visual trends and deploy them in fresh and exciting ways.
              </p>
              <p>
                The skills that a product designer must have range from
                technical to human-centered design. Product designers take part
                in user research, prototyping, visualization, testing,
                analyzing, and communicating.

                Designers not only create useful products and images, but they
                also produce. The social context within which they operate
                circumscribes the choices designers can make in creating and
                marketing ideas.
